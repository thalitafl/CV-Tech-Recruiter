        <p>There is a quote I read a while ago which is exactly how my mind works when I’m thinking about my future objectives in life:
“If you see it in your mind you can hold it in your hand” - Bob Proctor

I would say that my life is full of stories but let’s talk about my career. It all started in college when I decided to follow my heart and work in Human Resources. I knew I would like working in HR but I couldn't imagine I would like it this much. Now, I cannot see myself doing anything else.

In my past experiences, I had an opportunity to work for two big pharmaceuticals companies. As an HR Analyst, I was responsible for recruiting, benefits and payroll processes. As a Recruiter, my main responsibility was matching top performing and rising professionals with the right career move.

In 2017, I decided to really challenge myself. I wanted to try something new and develop other skills to help my overall career. So, I jumped on a plane to the United States to learn more about their culture and language for 2 years. It wasn’t easy and in fact I was really scared to totally change my life, but it was totally worth it. In addition to learning the culture, I also had the opportunity to study Essentials of HR Management at Emory University where I learned some of the country's legislation and HR practices in the United States.

Nowadays I’m currently helping high performing individuals land amazing jobs at Sovos, a global technology company, where I’ve been growing my skills in full-circle recruiting and strategic sourcing for this industry as a Bilingual Recruiter. I’m also working on my MBA in Human Resources Management, to further increase my skills and knowledge of HR.</p>
